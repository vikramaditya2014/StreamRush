      "https://localhost:3000",
      "http://localhost:5173",
      "https://localhost:5173",
      "https://*.vercel.app",
      "https://*.netlify.app",
      "https://*.netlify.com",
      "https://*.firebaseapp.com",
      "https://*.web.app"
    ],
    "method": ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS", "HEAD"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600,
    "responseHeader": [
      "Content-Type",
      "Authorization",

      "access-control-allow-origin",

      "access-control-allow-headers"
    ]
  }
]
```

6. **Click "Save"** button
7. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for changes to propagate

### Step 5: Test Your Setup
